# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If any of these files don't exist yet, proceed silently — don't flag their absence, don't suggest creating them upfront. `domain-modeling` (reached via `grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (this project is not a monorepo):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-....md
│   └── 0002-....md
└── router/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (...) — but worth reopening because…_

## Language

All domain docs, ADRs, and glossary entries are written in English (this project's portfolio/publication rule applies here too).
